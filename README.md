# Day4 
# Mi clone.
 ## Previously i made clone of adidas using normal functional component.
 ## Now its time to clear all the concopt of props in react.

 # What i learned?
 - Configure tailwind Css.
 - React props.
 - Re using components.
 - inject fonawesome in the index.html

 # What i learned abot props.
- we can destructure props instead of writing props again and again
 - inside tag we only use {props name}
 - for css props nee to be written in interpolation or template literal.
 - props is an object thats why we fetch value from its using key.
